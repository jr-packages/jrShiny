```{r}
## The UI
sliderInput("n", "Sample size", 10, 50, 25)
sliderInput("mean", "Sample mean", 0, 10, 5)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderText({
  max(rnorm(n = input$n, mean = input$mean))
})
renderPlot({
  plot(rnorm(n = input$n, mean = input$mean))
})
# Problem is that the max number in renderText doesn't match up to the max number on the plot i.e. the two separate rnorm calls are generating different samples of data.
```
